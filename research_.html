	<p> <b> <a href="PhuongHo_JMP.pdf"> Environmental Protection, Interjurisdictional Transport, and the Demographic Distribution of Solid Waste Disposal</a> </b> 	<br/>
Using data on intercounty waste flows in California and a structural model 
of haulers' decisions about where to deposit waste from each county, 
this paper studies the effects of environmental protection policies on 
the spatial and demographic distribution of solid waste. I find 
that waste is currently more likely to be hauled to disposal 
facilities in high percent black and Hispanic communities than 
white communities, even once I control for income, disposal fees, 
and transport distances, suggesting that unobserved characteristics of 
facilities and neighborhoods matter in haulers' decisions. I account 
for these factors by allowing for facility fixed effects in the demand 
model for waste disposal facilities. Results show that policies that 
limit waste flows would reduce intercounty waste transport but they 
generally would not lead to a more equitable distribution of trash. 
In particular, these policies tend to lead to substitution of waste 
away from facilities near white residents and toward facilities near 
Hispanic residents, potentially exacerbating distributional concerns.	</p>

	We model a spectrum auction where firms purchase units to participate 
	in a constrained, multi-product, downstream market. 
	We use dynamic programming techniques to numerically solve for the 
	optimal bidding strategy in a clock auction. Firms value constraining 
	competitor market power, so incumbents often bid aggressively to shut 
	out entrants. We find that high cost firms may hold up the market, 
	so the auction may be inefficient and generate zero revenue. 
	An auction may be optimal for a regulator maximising total surplus. 
	A regulator maximising auction revenue sets reserve prices high enough 
	to restrict spectra sold, effectively behaving as a monopolist.

	<p> <b> Nonlinear Pricing, Biased Consumers, and Regulatory Policy</b>  <a href="PhuongHo_NonlinearPricing.pdf">paper</a>
	<br/>
	Price schedules with increasing block tariffs have been used by 
	policy makers to regulate important markets such as water and 
	electricity. Although such tariffs are argued to promote equity, resource conservation, and revenue stability, they are usually not argued to promote efficiency. 
	This paper re-examines regulated non-linear pricing in light of recent 
	evidence regarding how consumers respond to complex price schedules. 
	Ito (2014) shows that, when confronted with complex price 
	schedules, electricity customers respond to changes in average price 
	(AP) rather than to changes in marginal price (MP). I find that 
	optimal regulated non-linear pricing 
	under AP response behavior is independent of the consumer
	 type distribution. Fixing consumer preferences
	  and the type distribution, increasing per-unit prices may be optimal
	   when consumers respond to AP, while decreasing per-unit prices are
	    optimal when consumers respond to MP.  These results suggest that
		 the equity-efficiency trade-off associated with increasing block
		  tariffs may be less severe than previously believed.

<p> <b>Race, Ethnicity, and the Distribution of Waste Flows</b> 
	</br>
I revisit questions on environmental justice in solid waste 
industry. Literature has documented an uneven distribution of 
environmental hazards among race groups, but they focus on total 
concentration of hazard at a site. I, on the other hand, distinguish 
waste amount at a facility by multiple flows from different origins 
coming to the facility. This gives four benefits. First, 
I identify the exposure disparities between racial/ethnic minority 
groups and white within neighborhoods of hazard sites. This contrasts 
to the literature that has compared communities within facility's buffers 
and other areas that are far away from hazards, which may be confounded 
by the initially disproportionate siting of facilities. Second, I separate 
the exposure disparity from economic characteristics of facilities that 
affect their receiving waste quantity such as disposal price and transport 
cost. Third, I identify the disparity that is not related to political 
capability by controlling for intercounty flows vis-&agrave-vis within-county 
flows. Fourth, I examine whether the disparity is an urban-rural story by 
exploiting the variation in waste flows that are sent from the same county 
to different destinations within a certain distance.
	</p>
<p> <b>The Effects of Flow Controls and Environmental Regulations in Solid Waste Industry</b> 
	</br>
This paper complements to the job market paper by adding the supply side to studying the equilibrium effect 
of flow controls and environmental regulations. The supply side assumes disposal facilities 
are competing in prices. I also distinguish the behavior of public facilities and private 
facilities to study another class of waste flow control besides interjurisdictional waste 
control. In 1994 the Supreme Court prohibited flow control that designate where waste 
must be disposed of, but they have recently revealed a more flexible view by upholding 
the county ordinances that directed all locally generated trash to local publicly owned 
processing facilities, citing that the previous court case had presented a 
privately-owned facility. I, hence, study the effects of such flow controls 
in the market where private facilities are competing in prices and public 
facilities are setting prices at average costs.	</p>

<b>	 Entry Deterrence in the Oligopolistic Hydro-Thermal Eletricity Market </b><br/>
	<p>This paper characterizes the two-period model of competition between one hydroelectric generator
	and multiple thermal generators in quantity setting. A variety of models are considered
to explore the entry deterrence by the hydro power plant. I consider both an open loop game,
and an alternative in which the hydro firm acts as a Stackelberg leader. I consider variations
in which ramping costs are included and ignored. Without including ramping cost, both games
indicate the same message: All firms produce larger output for the higher demanded period.
With the presence of ramping cost, both games imply thermal firms optimally produce the same
output between two periods if there is a small shift in market demand relative to ramping costs.
Nonetheless, Hydro does derive a benefit from acting as a Stackelberg leader. In particular, he is able to minimize the entry of thermal firms by forcing thermal firms to produce the same
amount in both periods even when there is a moderate shift in demand.
